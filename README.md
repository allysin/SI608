GOARN Network Analysis
Winter 2014

For my Networks class project, I worked on a team of three to analysis the Global Outreach Alert and Response Network
to understand how resilient it was, who the key players in responding to medical emergencies wer and also how these key players
tie the network together and bridge nodes on the network.
